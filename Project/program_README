README for how to operate the program
Andrew Gair, csci422 Project


--------------INPUT
The program takes a file from rsc directory as input
Files must follow this format:
D or U to signify directed or undirected graph
number of nodes total (n)
list of nodes and their neighbours
  each line is terminated with n
  the file itself is terminated with n
NOTE: you should supply each node, even if it
has no neighbours, simply terminate the line after
naming the node with the line termination character n.
IE:
D
2
0 1 2
1 2
2

Means that 1 has no neighbours, while 0 has 1 as a neighbour.

See rsc folder for several examples and testcases.


--------------COMPILE
Compile the program through the makefile
Typing "make" will compile the whole program.
Necessary files are stored in hdr and src.
The executable is called "project" and is placed
at this top level directory.


--------------RUNNING
Run the code with "./project rsc/filename"
The program will output the original graph and determine
if there are any cycles. It will then modify the graph
by removing nodes of degree 2 (if possible) and display
the resulting graph through the terminal window.


--------------FLAGS
You can see a more in depth version of how the code runs
by supplying a third command-line-arguement.
(this arguement is arbitrary, just the presence of a third
character is enough to trigger this in depth display).
IE: "./project rsc/filename set"
